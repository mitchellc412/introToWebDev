    <body><p>Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life...</p> 
          <p>He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</p> 
          <p>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.</p> 
          <p>He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.</p> 
          <p>Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.</p> 
          <p>It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
