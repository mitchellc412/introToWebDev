Intro to web dev assignment 2

I already had a GutHub account from a previous class, so I didn't have to go through the process of creating a new one.
My first step was to write up a couple random HTML files. I chose HTML because it's really easy to quickly write up something.
Next I just uploaded the files to main branch.
I didn't watch any tutorials because GitHub makes it pretty easy to upload new files.
